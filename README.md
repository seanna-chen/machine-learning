## Blood Pressure Status Classification

This was a group project done for a machine learning course. The topic was chosen because both my partner and I have interests in how sociological factors impact the health of an individual, and in this case specifically, the blood pressure.

This project was cleaned, coded, and visualized entirely in R.
